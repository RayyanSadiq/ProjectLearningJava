In Java, packages serve as containers for related classes and interfaces, aiding in organizing and managing code.
Understanding naming conventions and related concepts is crucial for creating well-structured and maintainable Java projects.

Naming Conventions:

Package Naming: Packages should be named using a reverse domain name, e.g., com.example.project. This helps prevent
naming conflicts and provides a clear hierarchy.

Package Names in Lowercase: Package names should be all lowercase to maintain consistency and readability.
Avoid Single Character Package Names: Descriptive names are preferred over short or single character names to enhance code clarity.
