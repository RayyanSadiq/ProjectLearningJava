        // Reference data types

        // an important rule of Reference data types is that they need to be capitalized when using them. This is because
        // technically all reference types are objects, and object are instances of classes which use the PascalNamingConvention.
        // Memory allocation in java mainly has two things, the heap where objects are stored and the stack where
        // variables are stored. Primitive types are stored in the stack with the variable their assigned to. However,
        // variables that hold objects are still in the stack, but the object is in the heap, this is why there called
        // reference types because they refer to an object in the heap.

        String Reference_type1 = "This is string"; // Strings are only defined in double quotes and are 8 bytes big

        JFrame frame = new JFrame();
        // here the first word JFrame is DECLARING the data type JFrame to our variable named "frame". Then we go through a process
        // called INSTANTIATION , which is the process of making a new instance of a class and INITIALIZING that to our "frame"
        // variable. So in basic instantiating is the process of creating new objects. The new keyword is used to allocate memory
        // for our new class, we don't have to worry about releasing it as JRE has that covered. The last word JFrame() is
        // the object created from the class called JFrame. That's what classes do they are just blueprints for objects
        // to be created from, nothing else. This is why we say an object is an INSTANCE of a class.

        // One thing you might notice is how "frame" has other methods and members in it, this is because classes have members
        // while primitive types don't.

        // Your also probably wondering that if String is a reference type why does it not have an instantiation process and what not?
        // this because String is being instantiated already under the hood, Java is already doing this because String is used a lot, you can see below
        // the "new String" part is greyed out cause its redundant.


        String string = new String("Ka");
        System.out.println(string);
