# Java Basics

Java Basics cover fundamental concepts essential for writing Java programs effectively. Below are some key topics
included in the Java Basics section:

## Data Types

Java provides built-in data types such as `int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`, etc. These data types are used to define
variables and store values.

## Casting

Casting is the process of converting one data type to another. In Java, casting can be done implicitly (automatic) or
explicitly (manual) based on the compatibility of data types.

## Loops

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. Java supports three types of
loops: `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.

## Strings

Strings are sequences of characters in Java. They are widely used for representing text and manipulating strings is a
common task in Java programming.

Understanding these fundamental concepts is crucial for building robust and efficient Java applications.
They provide the foundation for learning more advanced Java topics.
