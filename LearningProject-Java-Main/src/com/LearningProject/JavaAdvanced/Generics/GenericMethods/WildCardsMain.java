        // error here. While Instructor class is a descendant of user it still won't work. This is because "GenericList<Instructors>"
        // is not a subclass of "GenericClass<Users>", so it cant upcast it. GenericClass is not a subclass of itself.

        // We are dealing with a single class which is "GenericList" and it will accept any reference type
        // as its variable "T". The GenericList class cannot be a subclass of itself, "T" is just a parameter, and we cant upcast

        // This is what wildcards came to fix
        WildCardUtils.printUsersFixed(instructors); // fixed version after using wildcards
