The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
The pattern represents each state of an object as a separate class and delegates the state-specific behavior to these classes.
The object appears to change its class when its internal state changes.

Here's a breakdown of the key components and concepts in the State Pattern:

Context:
This is the class that contains the state. It is the object whose behavior is influenced by its state.
The context maintains a reference to the current state object.

State:
This is an interface or an abstract class that defines a set of methods for each state of the context.
Concrete state classes implement these methods, representing the specific behavior associated with each state.

Concrete State:
These are the classes that implement the State interface. Each concrete state class provides a specific behavior
associated with a particular state of the context.


The State Pattern allows an object to change its behavior dynamically at runtime by switching from one state to another.
This is achieved by associating a context with a state object, and the context can change its state object to alter its behavior.

This pattern is particularly useful when an object's behavior depends on its state, and this state can change during
the object's lifetime. Examples of where the State Pattern might be applied include the implementation of a vending machine,
a document editor with different editing modes, or an order processing system with various order statuses.
